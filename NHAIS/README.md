# NHAIS

NHAIS is a system that allows General Practice (GP) Surgeries to keep their patient registration and demographics data in sync with the regional Health Authorities (HA). Since the creation of this service the regional or area health authorities (approx 80) have since been replaced by a fewer number of successor organisations. There is however still a notion of every GP Practice’s patient being registered with one of the HAs.


## NHAIS Services and how to Deploy them

The installation guides within this section are based on NHSD’s recommended implementation patterns.  These patterns are detailed in two Exemplar Architectures available for AWS and Azure. 

A Docker image for each service has been created and can be found within Docker Hub along with the relevant install guidelines.
